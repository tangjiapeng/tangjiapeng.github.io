I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at the Technical University of Munich, supervised by [Prof. Matthias Nießner](http://niessnerlab.org/members/matthias_niessner/profile.html) in the [Visual Computing & Artificial Intelligence Group](https://www.niessnerlab.org/). I also work closely with [Prof. Justus Thies](https://justusthies.github.io/openings/) and [Prof. Angela Dai](https://www.3dunderstanding.org/).

Prior to my Ph.D., I received my master's Degree in the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, under the supervison of [Prof. Kui Jia](http://kuijia.site/) and [Prof. Xiaoguang Han](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/hanxiaoguang/). I received my Bachelor’s Degree in [South China University of Technology](http://www.scut.edu.cn/) (2018).  Between May 2020 and June 2021, I worked as a Research Intern in DAMO Academy, Alibaba, under the supervision of [Prof. Lei Zhang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang/). 

My current research interests focus on 3D generation reconstruction in computer vision. Recently, I am working on using diffusion models for 3D/4D/Head generation.
